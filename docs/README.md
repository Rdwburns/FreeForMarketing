# Free For Marketing

There are an awful lot of marketing tools out there these days to help make day-to-day tasks easier. If you're a freelancer, starting up or just on a tight budget, it can often be hard to figure out what's out there and whether it's *really* free to use. 

This list is designed to help you find what's out there. It's ever-growing and by no means complete, but hopefully you get something from it. If I've missed something, please contribute!

## Notes

- Free trials are acceptable if they are limited by usage or features but can't be a trial. Time-limited products must allow use for at least one year.
- Free tools cannot require you to use particular paid tools.
- Small Tools and Bookmarklets can be listed separately, even if they're part of the same domain, to make it easier for people to find a specific tool that they need.
- Anyone who suggests something which is on the list can (optionally) be included in the list of contributors. No company website links in contributors, only personal or freelancer websites or twitter links.
- If any of these links are not free, or I haven't provided enough information, please let me know (see *Contribute* below)
- If you like this or find it useful, you can help by making a contribution or [buying me a coffee.](http://ko-fi.com/rdwburns)

### To Do
I want to add sections for paid search and social, I just haven't got around to collating the links yet. This is coming.
